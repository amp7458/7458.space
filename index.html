        <h2>SKILLS</h2>
        <section id="skills">
            <p>I work with several programming languages when developing. My background includes working with
                languages such as JavaScript, HTML, Python, and Bash, contributing to projects that span from backend
                development to full-stack solutions.</p>
            <p>I was first introduced to programming around 2021 and have been consistently working to deepen my knowledge
                and
                expertise across various fields of software development. From exploring different languages and
                frameworks

        <h2>MY FAVORITE TOOLS</h2>
        <section id="tools">

            <h3>VS Code</h3>
            <p>
            I rely heavily on Visual Studio Code for coding due to its powerful extensions and integrated terminal. Its
            customization options, including themes and keyboard shortcuts, enhance my productivity and streamline my
            development workflow.</p>

            <h3>GitHub</h3>
            GitHub is my go-to platform for version control and collaboration. I use it to manage repositories, track
            issues, and review pull requests. Its collaborative features help me work efficiently with teams and
            contribute to open-source projects.

            <h3>MongoDB</h3>
            MongoDB is my preferred NoSQL database due to its flexible schema and scalability. I use it for applications
            that require dynamic data models and high performance, leveraging its powerful query language and indexing
            capabilities.

            <h3>AWS</h3>
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides the cloud infrastructure for my applications. I utilize various AWS
            services, such as EC2 for scalable computing resources and S3 for reliable data storage, ensuring that my
            applications are both robust and scalable.

            <h3>npm</h3>
            npm (Node Package Manager) is essential for managing JavaScript dependencies and packages in my projects. It
            simplifies the process of installing, updating, and sharing libraries, which helps in maintaining a
            streamlined development environment.
